TSEL - tail-call conditional branch

Synopsis: pop an integer off the data stack;
          test if it is non-zero;
          jump to the true address or to the false address
Syntax:  TSEL $t $f
Example: TSEL 335 346  ; absolute instruction addresses
Effect:
  $x,%s := POP(%s)
  if TAG($x) != TAG_INT then FAULT(TAG_MISMATCH)
  if $x == 0 then
    %c := $f
  else
    %c := $t
Notes:
  This instruction is the same as SEL but it does not push a return address
